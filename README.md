## 🐍 requests-practice

A collection of mini-projects that I created while learning how to use the `requests` module in Python. These projects helped me get comfortable with sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and interacting with APIs.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Each script demonstrates a specific concept I was working on. Here's the breakdown:

| File                     | Description                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 01\_status\_checker.py   | Check if a website is up using a GET request |
| 02\_joke\_fetcher.py     | Fetch a random joke from an API              |
| 03\_image\_downloader.py | Download an image from a URL                 |
| 04\_quote\_fetcher.py    | Get a random quote using a JSON API          |
| 05\_post\_example.py     | Send POST data to a test API                 |

Feel free to look around, explore, and learn from these examples.
