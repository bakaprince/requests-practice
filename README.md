# 🐍 requests-practice

A beginner-friendly collection of mini projects built using Python's `requests` library. This repository was created to practice core concepts like sending HTTP requests, handling responses, parsing JSON, downloading files, and interacting with public APIs.

---

## 📚 Projects Included

### 1. ✅ Website Status Checker
A script that accepts a URL and checks if the website is reachable (HTTP 200) or not. Good for learning how to handle HTTP response codes and connection errors.

### 2. 😂 Joke Fetcher
Uses the icanhazdadjoke API to fetch and display a random joke. Demonstrates setting custom headers and parsing JSON responses.

### 3. 🖼️ Image Downloader
Takes an image URL as input and downloads it to your machine. Shows how to stream and save binary content using `requests`.

### 4. 📝 Random Quote Generator
Fetches a random inspirational quote from a public API and prints it with the author's name. Good practice for working with external data and JSON parsing.
